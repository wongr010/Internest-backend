Look for alternatives for how to launch the website without 3rd party APIs to remove dependency on other companies


Concatenate black and white image with colour components to colourize the image
Use regression to estimate accurate image colour (compare with
actual coloured images)
L2 Regression
Classification loss w/ Rebalancing (more accurate)
Train the system using colour photos
Red-blue ambiguity - network cannot determine which colour to go with
Feed in images, separate into 1000 categories semantically to train networks
(apply class supervision weights)
Best result: supervised pre-training using human labels
Use colorization to avoid human supervision
set up pre-training scheme to induce usefule representation
split-brain autoencoder: combine grayscale with RGB channel

Combine the grayscale image with user inputted color to get more accurate results
You can use reference images to influence the end colourization result
